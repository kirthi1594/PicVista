Welcome to the Image Gallery project! This project allows you to create a visually appealing gallery to showcase a collection of images.

## Key Features
### Image Display
- Create a grid layout to display a collection of images. Each image should be clickable for a larger view.
### Lightbox Effect
- Implement a lightbox effect that opens when a user clicks on an image. The lightbox should display the clicked image in a larger format, with options to navigate to the next or previous images.
### Responsive Design
- Ensure that the image gallery is responsive and looks good on various devices. Use techniques like CSS Flexbox or Grid to create a flexible layout.
### Image Filtering
- Add categories or tags to each image, and provide a way for users to filter images based on these categories. This can be implemented with buttons or a dropdown menu.
### Image Loading Animation
- Include loading animations or placeholders for images to enhance the user experience, especially when dealing with larger images.
### Lazy Loading
- Implement lazy loading for images to improve page load times, especially if you have a large number of images.
### Thumbnail Navigation
- Add thumbnail images below the main gallery for quick navigation. Clicking on a thumbnail should open the corresponding image in the lightbox.
## Tech Stack
Choose technologies based on your preferences and what you've learned in your web development course. A basic tech stack for this project might include:

- HTML: Create the structure of your image gallery.
- CSS: Style your gallery for an aesthetically pleasing design.
- JavaScript: Implement the interactive features, such as the lightbox effect, image filtering, and lazy loading.
